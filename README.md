# Sweater Weather

## Project Description

I am a back-end developer working on a team that is building an application to plan road trips. This app allows users to see the current weather as well as the forecasted weather at the destination.

The team is working in a service-oriented architecture. The front-end will communicate with the back-end through an API. This project exposes the API that satisfies the front-end teamâ€™s requirements.
